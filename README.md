This repo is from COMP3002 and has a solution as well as a Turing Machine solution.
The file name should be .pseudo however it has been adjusted to .py for readability.

Problem - 
Solved an NP problem (Minimum k-cut) by implementing a Brute-Force Turing Machine Algorithm t
hat separates a graph into k number of components by minimising the total weight of a graph with a time complexity of O(2^n).
